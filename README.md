# TrainSchedule

https://danielpruitt.github.io/TrainSchedule/

This is a simple train schedule made to utilize Google Firebase and moment.js. A train can be logged with it's name, destination, departure time(12 hour, am or pm), and the frequency of it's arrival. Upon submission the train will be added to the database and appended to the page. Loading and logging on multiple pages will automatically show new trains on other pages. This project's purpose was to utilize Firebase and DOM manipulation in real time.
